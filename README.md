# RestService

This is a small application to test the Spring Boot framework and build a RESTful greeting service. When the 
program is running it can be accessed at: http://localhost:8080/greeting

USAGE: Users go to http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=[YOUR NAME]
This will generate JSON that gives the user a unique ID and prints "Hello, [YOUR NAME]!"
